========
This is a simple app that helps you manage your passwords. Alive @ <a href="http://pass.oguzgelal.com">pass.oguzgelal.com</a>

Problem
----------
- You have dozens of accounts and different passwords for each... ```you can't remember which pass you give to which service```
- You have the same password for every service... ```if one of your accounts get hacked, you are screwed```

Solution
-----------
- Enter the service name (find yourself a unique rule so it can't be guessed) *ex. hey!facebook*, *hey!twitter*, *hey!gmail*, *hey!paypal* etc.
- Determine a master password (It is OK if it is simple) *ex. 123456*
- Generate password. Use the same combination so passer will generate the same password every time.
